# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Handling Null Values in $group

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines when dealing with `$group` and null or missing fields. The `$group` stage's behavior with nulls can lead to unexpected results if not handled correctly.

## Bug Description

The provided aggregation pipeline attempts to group documents by a field that might contain null or missing values.  This results in an incorrect count in the output, because documents with null values will not be grouped properly.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a stage to the pipeline to handle null values before the `$group` stage.  One approach is to use the `$ifNull` operator to replace null values with a default value, or use a filter to exclude documents with null values in the targeted field.
